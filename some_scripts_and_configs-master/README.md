# some_scripts_and_configs
A couple of independent scripts or configs I have written for administrating some things, which either contain dummy things or are created for a very specific environment, so they don't deserve being published as gists. Feel free to use them, but be careful: these files might not fit your case very well, use some bad practices and/or be vulnerable
